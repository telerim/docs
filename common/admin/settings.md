# Application Settings

All our applications come with a settings page, which can be accessed from "Admin > Settings" on the menu. 

This page (and the menu) are only accessible by admin users.

The settings page gives the admin users ability to add / edit the following information:

* **Application name**: this is what is set in the browser title bar, as well as used in system e-mails sent to the users.
* **Copyright**: The name that shows up in the footer. This is typically the company name.
* **Pagination rows**: the number of items to show in the various list pages. This setting contacts the number in the list pages across the application (with a few exceptions).

Other applications may have some more specific settings that are documented in specific application documentation.
