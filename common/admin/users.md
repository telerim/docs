# User management

Administrators can manage users in all applications, being able to create, edit or inactive users to the application.

User information can be accessed through "Admin > Users" on the main menu. This page and menu item are only visible to administrators.

The "Users" page allows an admin to see a full list of users and search for specific users.

The "Add User" page allows an admin to add a user to the system. Note that if SSO (single sign on) options are enabled, there is no need to create a user in each system - the user only 
needs to be created once in the SSO system, and then will be automatically or manually imported into the specific application.

## User types

There are at least two types of users in all systems: 

* **Admin**: these are the system administrators, of which there can be more than one. When the system is installed, it comes with one default administrator account. Administrators can
do anything in the system, view all data, and can add / edit and activate or deactivate users.
* **User**: a regular user to the system.

Some systems have several more types of users. For example:

* The documentation system has users of type "editor" (who can edit articles) and "viewer" (who can only view articles).
