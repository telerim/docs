# Human Resources

The HR system is meant to allow users to easily add, edit and maintain several entities that are part of their work at the company, particularly:

* **Timesheets**: record time worked during the day, either through clocking in and out, or via the calendar. 
* **Vacations**: enter and keep track of vacation days throughout your time at the company

In addition, the HR system also serves as a central dashboard for the company to share information with its employees.

* **Annoncements**: view company-wide announcements on your dashboard.
* **Organization chart**: view who reports to whom, company wide, and get an idea of how the company is structured.
* **Company directory**: find contact information for your colleagues quickly.
* **Holidays**: view a list of official company holidays.
* **Reports**: see how many hours you've worked, a summary of hours worked, vacations taken, etc.

Managers also get additional views that enable them to see how their team is performing, and when they are taking vacations, etc.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page that you see when you login to the HR system. It looks like this.

The dashboard consists of several components:

* Clock in and out: the "start" and "stop" buttons let you clock in (when you get into work), and clock out (when you leave work).
* Recent timesheets: you can view your latest timesheets in this area.
* Vacations: see the number of vacations you've taken this year, and how many vacation days you have left. The buttons allow you to add vacation days, or view more detail.
* Hours worked: based on the timesheet you've entered, you can see the hours you've worked every day. A link leads to more detailed reports.
* Announcements: latest company-wide announcements, with a link to a page where you can see an archive of all announcements from the company.

A manager's dashboard view consists of one additional row:

* Vacations pending approval: a list of all vacations of staff reporting to the manager which have to be approved.
* Vacations this week: a list of all staff on vacation this week, and their vacation days.

## Timesheet calendar

This is a calendar-based view of timesheets. By default, it shows the weekly view of timesheets, though it is possible to view it in daily or monthly formats as well.

If your administrator has set up the right privileges, you will be able to add and edit timesheets using this calendar view. If not, you can only view timesheets using the calendar.

Managers are able to view their staff's timesheets using the calendar view, through selecting the user from the dropdown list on the top right of the page. If they are permitted, they can add or edit timesheets for their staff as well.

## Vacations

A list of vacations is visible through the vacations calendar view. You can also see official company holidays in this calendar. 

Users can add a vacation day by clicking on the day on the calendar view.
