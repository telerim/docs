# Projects and Tasks

This system helps you maintain your projects and tasks. It serves as a project management system, and to add tasks and mark them as done when complete.

The system has the following entities:

* **Tasks**: create tasks to keep track of what you and others are doing. You can also assign tasks to others, as well as add people who are interested as "watchers" to your tasks. 
Mark tasks as complete once they are done, or have a more detailed workflow where a task can go through multiple stages.
* **Projects**: maintain multiple projects to keep track of all the tasks that are in the system. 
* **Reports**: view reports of which users or departments have assigned the most tasks, or completed the most tasks, as well as how many hours went into particular tasks.
