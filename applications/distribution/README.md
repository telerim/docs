# Distribution Maps

The distribution maps system allows you to maintain a distribution system of whatever items you are distributing, store historical data, and see reports based on the distribution numbers.

This distribution system has the following concepts:

* **Locations**: Add / edit a list of all locations that you are distributing to
* **Location categories**: Allows you to categorize your locations according to various criteria. You can also color-code the location categories, so when they show up in the map,
they appear with the color code that you have set for the category.
* **Distribution**: store distribution numbers corresponding to each location. These are the numbers used to generate detailed reports.
* **Routes**: Locations and categories are nice, but sometimes you have specific routes for certain locations, and people who do distribution along those routes. Use the Routes 
feature to maintain and keep track of the various routes of distribution.
* **Problems**: While doing distribution, problems are bound to occur at various locations. Make note of those problems, when they occured, and when they were fixed, so that you can
document and generate reports on them.

In addition to storing data using the entities above, the distribution system helps you visualize the data in these following formats:

* **Full map**: view all locations, color-coded by category, on a full-screen Google Map. Clicking on a location will generate the latest distribution numbers in a chart, and 
clicking on the location will take you to the detailed page showing all distribution, problems and other details for that location.
* **Graph and table reports**: view highly detailed charts and reports of all your distribution data, either in table format (from which you can also download to Excel) or in graph format.

## Dashboard 

The dashboard shows a summary of the various locations, in both a map and list format. The dashboard also shows the list of the latest problems related to distribution that have been entered in the system.

## Locations

Locations allow you to name and place a distribution location on a map. 

"Locations > Map Editor" on the menu will allow you to add and edit the various locations in the map, as well as move around locations.

Clicking on a location in the Full Map will show the details for that location, and clicking on the name will take you to the location details page.

## Location Categories

Each location belongs to a category, which lets you categorize locations. You can also set a color for that category, and it shows up in a different color on the map.Distribution Maps

## Routes

In addition to location, you will often use routes to do the actual distribution to various locations. The Routes feature allows you to create, edit and view the routes along 
which the distribution is done.

## Distribution

The actual numbers for distribution, which are entered into the system for historical storage, and used to generate reports and numbers from. 

You can enter distribution data using "Distribution > Add Distribution" from the menu, and that allows you to enter data for all locations, or a filtered list of locations, for a 
specific day.

## Problems

You can store a list of problems encountered with various locations using the "Problems" menu. This lets a user report a problem with the location, which can be fixed in due time.

You can also upload photos and other files related to the problem, and view them in the detailed view page. This lets you keep an archive of all problems, and see which locations have
the most problem, and what are the most frequently occuring problems.

## Reports

You can view reports for your distribution numbers in a few places.

### Full map

This is a full screen display of the locations on a Google Map, and clicking on any of the locations will pop up a graph showing the latest distribution numbers. You can click on the location
for full details of that location.

### Graph report

Using "Distribution > Graph report" from the menu, you get to a graph page that shows you a summary of total distribution numbers going back a month, along with a breakdown across each
category. Clicking on a category name will take you to a detailed page that shows a further breakdown for each location in that category. You can change the date range to view longer time 
periods.

### Table report

Using "Distribution > Table report" from the menu, you get to a page that shows you total distribution numbers for each location in a table format, similar to a spreadsheet view. You can
download an Excel file from this page with the same data, if you want to do more detailed analysis with those numbers in Excel.
