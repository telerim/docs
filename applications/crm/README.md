# CRM

The CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system allows you to keep track of customers' contact details, record your communication with them and view reports related to this information over time. In addition, the system offers flexibility to the user in being able to customize the categories thereby tailoring the database to the user's own needs.

The many shortcuts to edit data creates a user-friendly interface - one can access and alter information both on the dashboard page, through the individual sections or in the drop-down options on the top toolbar.

The CRM system allows you to keep a record of:

* **Contacts**: search, view, add and edit your contacts hassle-free. Add notes quickly, as well as Deals and Events (see more about these below). Add your own categories to contacts. View contact's activity and editing history. 
* **Deals**: track deals put on the table for a contact. Record the amount and whether the offers are in "Process", "Accepted" or "Rejected".
* **Events**: keep track of scheduled appointments, deadlines, business events related a contact. View these on a calendar view or as a list. These events are fully custamaziable and can be added and edited as necessary. 
* **Call Scripts**: share successful call scripts with your colleagues in a centrally accesible place on this CRM system.
* **Dashboard**: This view offers a quick glance at the latest notes, upcoming events, recently viewed contacts, and an activity chart. 
* **Reporting**: Download data for reporting as Excel or CSV. Import CSV data into the system.
