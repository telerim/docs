# CRM

The CRM (customer relationship management) system allows you to keep track of customers and your contact history with them, and see reports related to this information over time.

The CRM system allows you to track:

* **Contacts**: add / edit your contacts here, and view their status change from lead to opportunity to account, or along whatever lines you set for yourself.
* **Events**: events related to your contacts. You can track all the calls, meetings, and other relationships you and others on your team have had with this contact over time, and
even view this on a calendar.
* **Deals**: track deals put on the table, offers closed, etc. 

## Contacts

This lets you add and edit your contacts. You can enter them one at a time, or import them from a CSV file in one go.

The contact view page lets you easily add an event or deal for that contact straight from the contact page.

## Contact Categories

This lets you create new categories for your various contacts. Not happy with the basic Lead, Opportunity and Account types? No problem: create your own! You can also color code
the categories so that you can easily view the various categories of your contacts.

## Events

Add events related to your contacts, such as phone calls, deals closed, etc. You can view your events in a list or in a calendar.

## Deals

Deals are any monetary transactions you have had or planned to have with your contacts. Keep track of which deals were on the table, and closed, and their amounts, and be able to see
reports over time.
