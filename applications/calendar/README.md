#Calendar

The Calendar application allows you to keep track of your events and appointments, as well as view others' schedules, search for free/available Resources, and book them.

## Resources and Users

You can add Resources like rooms, vehicles, spaces, equipment, etc. You can create these Categories (e.g. rooms, vehicles, spaces, equipment, etc.) by going in Resources -> Categories -> Add Category.

Afterwards you can select these categories when creating the Resouces. Add Resources (e.g. Green Room, Honda CRV, VIP area, Leica Camera etc.) by going in Resources -> Resources -> Add Resource.

Edit Resources in calendar view by picking background and text colors. You can do this either when adding a Resource, or by clicking on edit - a pen icon next to the desired resource in the "Action" column.

To change the color of the Resource select from a basic color, a saved color, or pick your desired shade through the "Advanced" tab. This way you can view all of the Resources at the same time after selecting them in the calendar view.

When booking events, your User Account will also appear in all the bookings as a "Resource" automatically. This way it gets booked into your calendar. If you remove your User Account (Resource) from that particular event, then the event will be un-allocated, though still viewable under the correct Resource.

You can also allocate other Users to events and this will also be done through the "Booking Calendar" box in My Calendar.

## Calendar View

This is a visual view of all your event bookings in a calendar view. You can view by day, week, month or snap to "today". Flip through days, weeks, months with forward/backward arrow.

View other user's calendars, and view multiple Resources simultaneously by starting to type the names of the Users and Resources in the Booking Calendar box, and selecting the ones you want.

## Events

### Add Events

You can add an event either by searching for a free Resource, or by going into "My Calendar" and entering the event. 

To add via Resource, go to Resources -> Find Resources -> select date range and category -> click on "+Add" to book the desired resource -> fill in the booking form.

When adding the event via Calendar view you can search for available spaces by adding resources to the "Booking Calendar" box and then directly selecting the desired time frame and then allocating Resources from there.

If there are any issues with your booking, for example because it's not possible to double book the same Resource on the same date and time, then an alert will notify you of the issue at the time you are making the booking, and information as to which bookings were unable to be booked will be listed.

### Edit and Delete Events

To edit an event, click on the occurence in the Calendar and amend the details. Here you can change the event name, date, amend description, switch to another owner, and reallocate resources. To delete the event entirely click on the red dust-bin icon at the bottom of the screen.

You will get an email when someone alters your event - keeping you informed about your bookings.

### Recurring Events

To create a recurring event, fill out the "recurring" section of the booking form.

![Events](/images/calendar/recurring.png)

The expiring recurring events can be found under Events -> Expiring Recurrences. You can select to view a list of these by end date, and also re-book them right away if the appointment is still relevant.
